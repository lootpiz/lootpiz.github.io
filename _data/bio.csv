"Heewon studied at Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, where he earned an MS and PhD in Biomedical Informatics. During his PhD, he utilized next-generation sequencing for variant- and gene-based analysis, to identify genomic variants that are associated with drug-induced side effects. Heewon continued his research as a postdoctoral fellow at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Canada, where he developed a translational framework for precision oncology using a compendium of preclinical pharmacogenomics datasets focused on drug combination therapies to improve current treatment strategies. Heewon is currently a Lead Bioinformatician at the Applied Spatial Omics Centre, Cumming School of Medicine, at the University of Calgary. His current research interests include profiling spatial gene/protein expression for prioritizing drugs based on microenvironment signatures for better therapeutic outcomes."
