"Heewon studied at Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, where he earned a MS and PhD in Biomedical Informatics. During his PhD, he utilized next-generation sequencing for variant- and gene-based analysis, in order to identify genomic variants that are associated with drug-induced side effects. Heewon continued his research as a postdoctoral fellow at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Canada, where he developed a translational framework for precision oncology using a compendium of preclinical pharmacogenomics datasets focused on drug combination therapies to improve current treatment strategies. Heewon is currently a Lead Bioinformatician in the Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute at the University of Calgary. His current research interests include profiling of spatial gene/protein expression in brain tumours for prioritizing drugs based on microenvironment signatures to overcome drug resistance."
