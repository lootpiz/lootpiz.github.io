"Heewon studied at Seoul National University in Seoul, Korea, where he earned both an MSc and PhD in biomedical informatics. During his doctoral training, he applied next-generation sequencing technologies for variant- and gene-based analyses, identifying genomic variants associated with drug-induced side effects. Following his PhD, he pursued postdoctoral research at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Canada, where he developed a translational framework for precision oncology. His work integrated large-scale pharmacogenomics datasets to design and evaluate drug combination therapies, aiming to improve treatment strategies in cancer. Heewon is currently a Senior Bioinformatics Scientist at the Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary. His research now focuses on translational microbiome science, where he applies computational and integrative approaches to uncover hostâ€“microbe interactions that drive chronic diseases. Beyond his research, Heewon is committed to collaborative science, open-source bioinformatics, and mentoring the next generation of computational biologists."
